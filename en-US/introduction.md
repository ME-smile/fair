```
There are few third-party libraries for flutter dynamization available in the flutter community.One the one hand,the developer team can absorb the opinions and suggestions  from the feedback of the community, which is conducive to the continuous improvement of the project itself.On the other hand,it can provide reference and ideas for developers.
```
   * **Fair is a technology-driven part-time project**
```
All processes are dominated by technology,From project design, to collaborative development, to final output.All  participants joined maintian and develop new features for the project in their part-time.Fair follow-up maintenance will also continue to exist as part-time jobs.

* **Flutter hotfix**

  **App hotfix usually includes both business logic and user interface.At current stage, fair is designed for UI dynamization ,business logic delivery is not inclueded. To support logic layer, logical widgets should to be built-in and packaged  in advance. *It is like the Module and Action that follow version iteration in Hybrid and Recact-Native system* **
